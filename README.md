# NLP@UCSF Learning Project: Building a Classifier to Categorize Clinical Trials
## Repo Name: classify-clinical-trials

Project Summary: Over the next few months, we want to build an NLP based classifer that will be used to categorize Clinical Trial Descriptions (from clinicaltrials.ucsf.edu/browse) according to the condition/body system they describe.

Our theory is that the text descriptions of similar trials will be similar and we are attempting to test that theory in order to categorize trials that are currently in the "other" bucket.
