While this makes sense - we have 6 reviews, we should have 6 rows in the document term matrix, it is also a problem since we want to be able to match an \"unknown\" product description to a single product type. Having multiple records with a single product type muddies the waters and makes it more difficult to select the \"right\" record.\n",
