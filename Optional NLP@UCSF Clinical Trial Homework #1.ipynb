    "## Optional Homework #1\n",
    "\n",
    "For anyone looking to try out their skills, try one or all of these exercises:\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with the data file: \"clinical_trial_data.json\" or the in-memory version of the data, as generated by the Jupyter Notebook \"Clinical Trial Data Extraction.ipynb\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 1\n",
    "Each of the clinical trials listed includes some standard text headers such as \"Summary\", \"Keywords\", \"You can join if...\" For this task, you will need to remove these standard headers from the data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Excercise 2\n",
    "The clinical trial text data is currently stored line by line (ie - anytime there is a carriage return/newline create a new element in the text data list), but not necessarily sentence by sentence (ie - anytime there is a natural end to a sentence (period, exclamation point, etc) create a new element in the text data list). For each trial, merge the lines, then use SPACY or NLTK to split the lines by sentence. This will create a more \"NLP friendly\" dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 3\n",
    "Because there is a section that includes pre-built keywords, and these keywords are important (and a varying token length), it would be helpful to 'set them aside'.  Build a new data structure that separates the keywords out from the rest of the raw text data and saves them in a list, alongside the other clinical trial level meta-data (ie-trial link, trial name, etc)."
