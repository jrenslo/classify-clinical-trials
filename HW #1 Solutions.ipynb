    "## Optional Homework #1 (for the updated JSON file)\n",
    "\n",
    "For anyone looking to try out their skills, try one or all of these exercises:\n",
    "\n",
    "The data structure used by clinicaltrials.ucsf.edu needs a number of fields and formatting choices that are important for keeping their webpage operational, but aren't ideal for our needs. However, if we want our modeling work to be useful, we need a way to easily join the outcome of our NLP model to the production JSON data structure.  The production data structure is a dictionary of dictionaries, with the primary key being the clinical trial \"nct_number\": an 11 digit unique identifier beginning with the string \"NCT\" (ie - 'NCT12345678').  Our NLP data structure, should therefore also be indexed by this identifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, only certain trials are visible on the website, so we will need to know which trials are considered \"visible\" and \"joinable\", so we can appropriately categorize only the visible trials. The variable names in the JSON are 'is_joinable' and 'is_visible.'\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 1\n",
    "Your first task is to build a smaller test dataset that removes some of the fields we do not care about. Create a new data structure, and for each trial, copy over only the data that you believe would be useful as inputs to our model (plus the variables mentioned above) and save it to disk. Remember that modeling works best when we focus on the details that change appreciable between our unit of analysis (ie - trials.) In other words, your choise of variables to retain should not be things like \"sponsor\" or \"recruitment status\" because they won't really contribute much to our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 2\n",
    "Many of the most interesting fields (like 'summary') are riddled with formatting characters. This is great for hosting a website, but it is just noise for our NLP work.  For each of the free-text fields you've extracted in Exercise 1, remove all of the HTML formatting (Hint: The python package BeautifulSoup can be very useful here!).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 2a\n",
    "If you'd like to extend excercise 2, it would be useful to use Spacy/NLTK or something else to break the free text sections from excercise 2 into individual sentences and store them as elements in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 3\n",
    "Our goal for our modeling project is to categorize each of the trials into a unique category.  The language of clinicaltrials.ucsf.edu defines \"clusters\" as the primary category, and \"conditions\" as the sub-category.  Each trial can be classified as relating to multiple \"conditions\", and each condition can belong to multiple \"clusters.\" This complicates our modeling task appreciably. To simplify our project, we will assume that all \"conditions\" are adequately assigned (not a bad assumption, there are very few conditions = \"other\") and we will assume that any clincical trial that has at least 1 \"cluster\" not equal to \"Other\" can be categorized into that non-other cluster.  In other words, we are only interested in classifying trials that cannot be otherwise categorized.\n",
    "\n",
    "For exercise 3, please create a field in our data structure that indicates whether a specific trial has ONLY \"other\" clusters (even if there are more than 1). "

Relapsed retinitis generally responds to reinduction and maintenance therapy, but the interval between successive relapses progressively shortens. The CRRT addressed the issue of the management of relapsed CMV retinitis.The CRRT was a multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial comparing three regimens in patients with relapsed retinitis. Patients with AIDS and CMV retinitis that had relapsed or was nonresponsive to initial therapy were randomized to one of three regimens: (1) intravenous foscarnet reinduction at 90 mg/kg twice daily for 2 weeks, followed by maintenance therapy at 120 mg/kg/day; (2) intravenous ganciclovir reinduction at 5 mg/kg twice daily for 2 weeks followed by maintenance at 10 mg/kg/day; and (3) combination therapy, wherein patients continued their previous therapy and were reinduced with the second drug and then placed on maintenance therapy with foscarnet at 90 mg/kg/day and ganciclovir at 5 mg/kg/day.',\n",

It is the second most frequent condition, after the common cold, for which patients see a physician or lose days from work. Estimated costs to those who are severely disabled from low back pain range from $30-70 billion annually. Rates of spinal surgery in the U.S. have increased sharply over time, and researchers have documented 15-fold geographic variation in rates of these surgeries. In many cases, where one lives and who one sees for the condition appear to determine the rates of surgery. Despite these trends, there is little evidence proving the effectiveness of these therapies over nonsurgical management.This study will use the National Spine Network to conduct a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial for the three most common diagnostic groups for which spine surgery is performed: lumbar intervertebral disc herniation (IDH), spinal stenosis (SpS), and spinal stenosis secondary to degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS). This arm of the trial will deal with patients from the third diagnostic group. The study will compare the most commonly used standard surgical treatments to the most commonly used standard nonsurgical treatments. We will conduct the study at 12 sites throughout the United States.The primary endpoint of the study will be changes in health-related quality of life as measured by the SF-36 health status questionnaire. Secondary endpoints will include patient satisfaction with treatment, utility for current health in order to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALYS) as the measure for cost-effectiveness, resource use, and cost.We will follow patients at 6 weeks and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to determine their health status, function, satisfaction, and health care use.

Each trial can be classified as relating to multiple \"conditions\", and each condition can belong to multiple \"clusters.\" This complicates our modeling task appreciably. To simplify our project, we will assume that all \"conditions\" are adequately assigned (not a bad assumption, there are very few conditions = \"other\") and we will assume that any clincical trial that has at least 1 \"cluster\" not equal to \"Other\" can be categorized into that non-other cluster.
